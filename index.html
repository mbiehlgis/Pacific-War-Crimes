              <h3 class="preamble">One of the greatest failures in education is the outright neglection of history, especially
                history that continues to heavily impact the world today. A quintessential case of this can be found in how the
                American education system's learning material on World War II is disproportionately Euro-centric with stark ignorance
                of how the war raged on in the other half of the world. The periods before and between Pearl Harbor and the atomic bombing
                of Hiroshima goes entirely untouched. To put things into perspective, the death rate for Allied POWs captured by Germany was
                approximately 4%, whereas the death rate for Allies captured by the Japanese was a staggering 27%/ The inhererent issue with
                the ignorance of facts like this is that American students are not learning the events and the causes behind them that lead to
                horrific scenes in the far east, which could in turn pave a path for the world to repeat those mistakes. The interactive is also
                not representative of every occurence of a Japanese war crime, but only a small sample of them for the sake of starting a
                conversation about the issue. Nor is this site designed to portray Japan as the sole Pacific Theatre party to have commit
                such acts of inhumanity.

                  <p class="crimetext"><b>February 14th, 1942:</b> On this Saturday afternoon on the grounds of a British Military Hospital Site,
                    invading Japanese forces encroached on the facility after pushing through British defenses. The hospital itself had already
                    faced heavy artillery throughout the morning along with internally poor conditions such as low food and water rations, scarce lighting,
                    an overcapacity of patients, and an inability to properly bury the deceased. When the 1st Japanese soldiers were visible to the hospital
                    guards, a Red Cross field worker was sent to discuss terms with the Japanese, however he was fired at upon first site despite his attempts
                    to point out his Red Cross affiliation. The Japanese forces, under the command of General Tomoyuki Yamashita, attacked the hospital for the
                    next hour going room by room executing, beating, and bayonetting all personnel as well as patients. A projected 50 people were killed in this
                    first wave of attacks. Afterwards, the remaining 300 victims were forced on a march away from the hospital back towards Japanese controlled
                    territory, those who fell or were unable to continue walking were executed.

                    <p class="crimetext">Once the remaining prisoners arrived at the temporary Japanese base, they were separated into groups of approximately 70-80 and locked
                    in 3 small rooms with hot temperatures and no access to water. As some died overnight to their previous wounds, the following morning some
                    POWs were let out with the promise of water. However, shortly after they left the room, those that remained report hearing screams out in the
                    distance, indicating that they were in fact being executed. Before the rest were killed however, the camp was struck by artillery, distracting
                    the Japanese forces allowing for the escape of some of the POWs. In the end, a total of roughly 150 British POWs along with a handful of local
                    hospital staff were killed in the massacre.

                  <p class="crimetext"><b>February 18th - March 4th 1942:</b> After the surrender of the British in their colonies of Singapore and Malaya in 1942, the
                    invading Japanese forces set forth on a campaign to purge any suspected anti-Japanese Chinese citizens residing in the newly conquered territory. The systemic purge was
                    carried out by the Imperial Japanese Army's secret police dubbed the "Kenpeitai". Under the Kenpeitai's rule, several mass executions and tortures
                    were carried out by their auxiliary enforcement units named the "Hojo Kenpei", however the 3 most notable and infamous were located at Punggol Point,
                    Changi Beach, and Belakang Mati Beach. Over the course of Japan's occupation of the area, over 30,000 suspected Chinese residents were executed.

                      <b>Changi Beach:</b> On February 20th, 1942, the first of the Sook Ching mass killings took place. On this day, 66 Chinese male citizens were rounded up
                      and marched to the Changi Beach shoreline and executed via firing squad. Along Changi's main road, a suspected 250 more victims were executed in a separate massacre after
                      the discovery of a mass grave after the war ended. It would mark the beginning of a harsh and brutal occupation for Singapore's Chinese community.

                      <b>Punggol Point:</b> During this event, around 1,000 Chinese residents in the Upper Serangoon neighborhood were forcibly taken from their homes by
                      the Hojo Kenpei. While nearly 600 were either killed when resisting capture, another 400 were marched to the Punggol Point shoreline and executed
                      via firing squad. In the decades following the massacre, residents and fishermen who frequented the beach would occasionally discover human bone fragments
                      and even a skull in one instance.

                      the shoreline however, human bodies exhibiting multiple bullet wounds began washing up due to a mass firing squad execution that took place on a Japanese
                      Naval Vessel. The British were then forced to bury the remains as they awaited their internment.

                    200+ Australian and Dutch POWs were summarily executed and buried in a mass grave. During prosecutions for war criminals after the war, prosecutor Major
                    Alex Mackay told the court "The Australians were killed in a spirit of revenge." What he inferred was that this specific event was Japanese retaliation
                    for the deaths of 20 Japanese navy crew members after their vessel struck a mine. Survivors of the attack were in fact a part of the squad that executed
                    the 200 men.

                  <p class="crimetext"><b>February 12th - February 16th 1942:</b> On the eve of the fall of Singapore to Japanese forces, a royal yacht carrying wounded Australian
                    servicemen, nurses, as well as women and children attempted to escape but was sunk at sea East of Indonesia. Around 100 survivors managed to swim to the nearby Bangka Island,
                    not knowing the island was already under Japanese control. The officer in command believed the best chance at survival for the survivors was to surrender themselves
                    to the nearest Japanese encampment. After returning with around 20 Japanese soldiers, all servicemen capable of walking were ordered to walk away with the officers. A repeated
                    series of gunshots rang out before the 20 Japanese soldiers returned. Upon their return, reports released in 2019 revealed that the soldiers tortured and raped
                    the nurses before ordering them to tread out into the sea where all but one would be executed by machine gun fire. Once the machine gun fire stopped, the soldiers returned
                    to bayonet the remaining wounded servicemen on the beach. The only surviving members were Australian Army nurse Sister Vivian Bullwinkle, as well as 2 wounded servicemen.

                <p id="I" class="crime">SS Behar Massacre</p>

                  <p class="crimetext"><b>March 1944:</b> In early 1944, the Imperial Japanese Navy(IJN) set forth upon a series of naval raids on Allied supply ships under the command of Naomasa Sakonju to try
                    and hinder ground forces already on land. On March 9th, the IJN struck and sunk the British merchant ship SS Behar, but not before approximately 104 of the Behar's crew abandoned ship.
                    (It should be noted that attacking a neutral ship is considered a war crime under the Geneva Convention, capturing and unharming them however is not). Soon after, the Japanese warship 'Tone' went out to collect the crew that jumped
                    overboard and subsequently inprison them. However, this set of events went against Sakonju's initial orders to capture the ship and abandon any non-essential personnel. As a result, the Behar
                    sent out a distress signal to other Allied ships, forcing the Japanese to retreat from their mission to the Netherlands East Indies. After 2 days, Sakonju ordered the commanding officer of
                    the Tone, Haruo Mayuzumi, to execute the 104 British crewmembers to try and cover up the attack. Mayuzumi however felt strongly against the killings as he was a practicing Christian, and even
                    requested Naomasa twice to give the prisoner's mercy. Mayazumi however was sharp in his convictions, and ordered Mayuzumi to obey. That night, Mayuzumi sent 15-34 <em>disputed)</em> of the Behar's officers and the only 2
                    surviving women to the Japanese ship 'Aoba' to be taken ashore as they would be spared and sent to a POW camp. The remaining 69 men however were executed via beheading by all of the Tone's officers except for Mayuzumi who only
                    watched from the ship's bridge, refusing to take part in the murder.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After the war ended, the Allies prosecuted the Japanese officer's involved in the crime. Sakonju was tried and convicted in Hong Kong by the British and sentenced to death. Mayuzumi
                    however was onky sentenced to 7 years in prison for his role.

                  <p class="crimetext"><b>March 1944:</b> Another massacre at sea in relation to Japan's 1944 naval campaign to raid enemy supply ships was the attack on Dutch merchant ship "SS Tjisilak".
                    While travelling from Melbourne, Australia to Colombo, Sri Lanka with a mix of Chinese, Dutch, and English seamen plus a handful of passengers and defensive gunners, the SS Tjisilak came into contact with the
                    Japanese submarine I-8. At 5:45 am, the I-8 struck and sunk the Dutch ship with a torpedo, killing one crewmate instantly and sending the rest to abandon ship and escape to the lifeboats.
                    The I-8 then emerged from the water and began capturing the some 105 surviving members. While the commanding Dutch officer was being interrogated by the I-8's commander, a Chinese crewmate
                    slipped into the water and was shot instantly, with the I-8 crew believing an escape was attempted. In turn, the I-8 crew tied the rest of crew in pairs and began to beat them with their
                    weapons. 4 of the men jumped into the water to escape the torture and miraculously managed to escape despite the subsequent gunfire at them. After the Japanese had killed about 20 of the members,
                    they bound the rest together with rope and forced them overboard, drowning the rest of the crew.

                    <br>
                    The I-8 would then go on to strike the US Liberty ship the "SS Jean Nicolet", where a similar set of events occurred once more.

                  <p class="crimetext"><b>March 1944:</b> Based in the Pingfang district of Harbin in Northeast China was the headquarters for what is infamously referred to as "Unit 731".
                    What began as a routine research and public health agency for Japanese occupied Chinese territory. Over time however, it evolved into a facility designed to
                    study and weaponize a variety of diseases as well as the study of how much the human body can endure. The way this was accomplished however was via the torture and
                    exploitation of local Chinese residents and allied POWs.

                    <b>Biological Warfare: </b>One of the primary methods of studying potential biological weapons was the deliberate breeding of plague-infected fleas and the subsequent
                    aerial release of them over Chinese communities. These mass tests resulted in the deaths numbering in the hundreds of thousands. A potential 12 large-scale field tests
                    were attacked by Unit 731's biological agents. Some other diseases released to the Chinese populace were Cholera, smallpox, and botulism.

                    to study their effectiveness on the human bodies. Among the weapons used were bayonets, grenades and other explosives, rifles, and even flamethrowers.

                    the Kempeitai Secret police rounded up for "suspicious activities". These test subjects were then deliberately injected with deadly diseases under the guise of it being a
                    vaccination in order to derive the most accurate of data. Along with the direct injection of diseases was the forced intercourse between subjects in order to spread and study
                    venereal diseases, namely syphillis.

                  <p class="crimetext"><b>December 1937 - January 1938:</b> Potentially considered the most infamous of Japanese war crimes is commonly referred to as "The Rape of Nanking", which took place after the Imperial Japanese Army
                    captured the Chinese capital of Nanjing. During this 6-week period, upwards of 200,000 innocent Chinese citizens were tortured, raped, and killed by occupying Japanese soldiers. Being that the event took place over such
                    an extended period of time, a myriad of various crimes and slaughters took place. A common theme found throughout all of the atrocities however is the absolute lack of humanity from the officers and soldiers present.

                      <p class="crimetext"><b>Massacre Contest: </b>One instance during this horror was the purported "massacre contest" that took place between two Japanese officers by the names of Toshiaki Mukai and Tsuyoshi Noda. The
                      details of the "contest" they took part in entailed a race to see which of the 2 kill 100 civilians first with a katana. After this initial "round", they realized they had gotten too blood-lusted
                      and lost count, so they began another round a few minutes later only the goal had now been raised to 150 people. The crime was originally published and framed by Japanese media as a "heroic killing of the Chinese".
                      After the war, Mukai and Noda were both detained, prosecuted, and executed for their crimes.

                      <b>Mass Rape: </b>Along with the outright massacre of Chinese civilians were the mass rapings that occurred every day and night of the 6 weeks. Japanese soldiers were given free reign to systematically
                      travel door-to-door to capture, rape, and murder any women, as well as young girls and boys, over the course of this horrific event. There were also multiple cases of soldiers forcing family members to
                      commit sexual acts upon one another. It wasn't uncommon for the soldiers to mutilate the victims' genitalia with their bayonets or broken shards of glass after assaulting them. Pregnant women also were not
                      spared from these heinous actions.

                      <br>
                      <b>Lingering Effects: </b>The scale and scope of this atrocity still plays a huge role in Sino-Japanese relations, where some Japanese ultra-nationalists claim the event to have been highly exaggerated, namely
                      due to how the IJA quickly tried expunging any and evidence of the crime before Japan's surrender in 1945. It took until August 15th, 1995, the 50th anniversary of Japan's surrender for Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama
                      to give Japan's first formal apology to the people of China. Despite the presence of a large business and trade relationship between the two nations today, many Chinese citizens are still distrustful of the
                      Japanese due to their hesitance to admitting their guilt.

                    <p class="crimetext"><b>February 1945 - March 1945:</b> As Americans campaigned closer and closer to the Japanese homeland, the Philippine islands were slowly but surely being reclaimed by allied forces. The overseer
                      of all IJA activity in the country, General Tomoyuki Yamashita, even requested an immediate withdrawal of his forces from Manila in January to prevent the now dire situation he and his men faced, but this order was
                      ignored by his subordinate Rear Admiral Sanji Iwabuchi, who chose to stay along with his 10,000 men. However his forces were quickly outgunned and outmatched by the growing American military presence in the city;
                      his marines in turn became increasingly angered and hostile, often taking out there frustrations on Filipino civilians in the brief respites between battle. By the time American marines regained full control of the
                      capital, nearly 100,000 Filipino civilians had been been killed by the Japanese.</p>

                      <br>
                    <p class="crimetext">The crimes these soldiers inflicted upon these Manila civilians were eerily reminiscent of those committed in Nanking 8 years earlier. Thousands of men, women, and children were tortured
                      and butchered, often with bayonets. Along with the killings were several mass rapes of women and girls as young as 12 by the Japanese. During the trials of the officers responsible for the killings, it was
                      revealed that the local Bayview Hotel was designated by the Japanese as a 'Rape Center', where some 25 local Filipino girls were abducted from their homes and kept in the building for officers to repeatedly rape.</p>

                    <p class="crimetext">Despite these atrocities taking place under the command of Rear Admiral Iwabuchi, it was General Yamashita who was convicted and put on trial for the war crimes that took place.
                      However, there existed no evidence that Yamashita committed any crimes, ordered them to happen, or had the capability to stop them. Regardless, General MacArthur and 5 other generals chose to hold
                      him accountable since he was in command of all Japanese troops at the time. A group of American military lawyers tried to defend Yamashita by appealing to the Supreme Court who ultimately rejected
                      the appeal 5-2. Yamashita was executed by hanging February 23rd, 1946 in Manila.

                  <p class="crimetext"><b>April 1942:</b> After 3 months of battle between American and Filipino soldiers under the command of General Douglass MacArthur, and the invading Japanese
                    under the command of General Masaharu Homma, the Bataan Peninsula finally fell in early April of 1942, a much sooner surrender than the Japanese expected. An unexpected result of the
                    relatively quick surrender of the peninsula was the massive underestimation of expected POWs which ranged from 60,000-80,000 American and Filipino troops. General Homma was
                    then forced with the daunting logistics task of transporting tens of thousands of men to the prison camp North of the peninsula, a staggering 65 miles away. While Homma was busy
                    devising a plan to move the prisoners, a forced stripping of material possessions from the men, however any men who were found to have any Japanese items or money on them were executed
                    for allegedly looting Japanese corpses. </p>

                  <center><img src="img/bataanline.jpeg" style="width:80%"></center>
                  <br>
                  <p class="crimetext">Homma soon realized the only option he had to get these POWs out of the area before beginning his next assault was to have them physically march there. He then gave the
                    order to have his subordinate officers facilitate this move, which he ordered to have done peacefully. His serving officer Colonel Masanobu Tsuji chose to go against his wishes and gave private orders of
                    his own to other officers encouraging them to summarily execute their respective sets of captives. Due to these orders, an estimated 400-500 Filipino officers were soon gathered along the Pantingan River and
                    executed via gunshots, bayonets, as well as beheadings. </p>
                  <center><img src="img/Pantingan.jpg" style="width:80%"></center>
                  <br>
                  <p class="crimetext">Eventually the march was in motion, where the POWs faced intense heat, exhaustion, starvation, and drought all under the threat of being killed for falling out of line. It should be noted that many
                    men had already been wounded and fatigued from the months of battle preceding the march. A common form of torture used on the men was referred to as "Sun Treatment", where men were forced to sit in the blistering heat
                    without any forms of shade for hours on end, some placed just in sight of fresh water. Anyone who asked for water however was immediately shot. Some men who simply could not walk any longer collapsed on the road where
                    they would either be bayonetted, left for dead, or ran over by passing Japanese trucks. Guards would also randomly stab prisoners with bayonets for no reason at all. </p>

                  <br>
                  <p class="crimetext">When the first part of the march ended at San Fernando railhead, the men were divided into hundreds and forced into unventilated box cars which only had a capacity of 40.
                    Inside the box cars on the way to the next destination, the men now faced a rapid spread of dysentary and disease. They eventually reached Capas train station where they would face the final 9
                    miles of their march. Despite reaching the prison camp, the rate of deaths continued at several hundreds per day due to fatigue and disease. Of the original 80,000 Americans and Filipinos that
                    started the march, only 54,000 remained. Of the deaths, an estimated 18,000 were filipino and 600 were American, with several men still unaccounted for. </p>

                    <p class="crimetext"><b>14 December 1944:</b> In mid-August of 1942, 300 American POWs captured during the Battle of Bataan were shipped to a slave work camp in Palawan, an elongated island Southeast of Manila.
                      For the next 2 years, the imprisoned Americans would be forced to perform slave labor for the Japanese clearing and building an 8 inch thick 1500 yard long runway to resupply and refuel Japanese war planes.
                      As Japan lost more of its control over the course of the war, rations for prisoners became growingly scarce, resulting in most POWs receiving just 1 bowl of rice per day.In September of 1944, half of the orignal
                      300 POWs were sent back to Manila to be redesignated elsewhere in the Japanese supply line. </p>

                    <center><img src="img/palawan.jpeg" style="width:50%"></center>
                    <p class="crimetext">  One month later, the airfield the men constructed began to face multiple Allied bombing raids that destroyed a notable amount of Japanese planes and ship. While rejoiced at the renewed hope of being freed,
                      the situation at hand forced the men to build trenches to take cover in. In December however, American forces were on the brink of defeating the Japanese controlling the camp's area of the island. To prevent the rescue
                      of the men, the commanding officers purposefully sounded off the air raid alarm indicating for the men to get into the trenches they built. Japanese soldiers then surrounded the trench and proceeded to douse it and the
                      prisoners and gasoline before setting them on fire. Prisoners who managed to escape the flames were shot while those burning inside were stabbed with bayonets. Just 11 men managed to escape their deaths.</p>

                      assisted in pointing out Japanese officers and guards in charge and present at the massacre who were subsequently tried for their crimes. Today, 123 of the victims are now buried in a mass grave at Jefferson Barracks National Cemetary
                      in St. Louis, Missouri.
